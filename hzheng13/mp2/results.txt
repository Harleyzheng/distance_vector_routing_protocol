test results:

 DV/PV send message over 3 node topology succeeded!
-10:  DV/PV shortest path in example topology failed. (don't forget tie-breaking logic: for the example topo, sending from 6 to 3 should take path 6 1 4 3) 

 DV/PV shortest path in 8x8 grid topology succeeded!
 DV/PV switch to better path when available succeeded!
-10:  DV/PV fall back to worse path failed. 

-10:  DV/PV report unreachable after partition: failed. 

-10:  DV/PV heal after partition: failed.
