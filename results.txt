test results:

-25:  DV/PV send message over 3 node topology failed: one of your nodes did not write a log

-10:  DV/PV shortest path in example topology failed. (don't forget tie-breaking logic: for the example topo, sending from 6 to 3 should take path 6 1 4 3) 

-10:  DV/PV shortest path (0->77, 77->0, 23->50) in 8x8 grid topology failed. 

-10:  DV/PV switch to better path when available failed. 

-10:  DV/PV fall back to worse path failed. 

-10:  DV/PV report unreachable after partition: failed. Sender reported unreachable before the topology was partitioned.

-10:  DV/PV heal after partition: failed. 

-10:  DV/PV with lots of link up/downs failed.
